Goal: Collect the most relevant, current information about the topic from a defined list: "{topic}".
Constraints:
- If ALLOWED_SOURCES is provided, restrict searches/citations to that set.
- Focus on today and the last 48h; add background only as needed.
- Prefer primary/authoritative sources; avoid tabloids.
Method:
1) Use your web tool to run 3–6 targeted queries: breaking reports, official statements, data/figures, timeline, expert commentary.
2) De-duplicate; note disagreements.
3) Extract per finding: date/time (UTC), location, key entities, numbers/quotes, short summary.
Output (no HTML):
- Key Findings: 5–12 bullets (with UTC timestamps).
- Subtopics/Threads: related angles.
- Source Log: [Publisher] — Title — URL — Date(UTC) — Credibility(1–5).
- Gaps/Unknowns: what remains unverified.
Notes: Use absolute dates (e.g., 2025-08-13 15:20 UTC)."""

Inputs:
- ARTICLE_HTML: HTML output from article_publisher (pre-internal-links).
- KEYPHRASE: primary keyphrase (string).
- Optional: SYNONYMS (comma-separated), CATEGORY, TAGS_CSV, EXTERNAL_SOURCES (array of reputable {title,url} candidates).
Goal: Improve rankings and CTR while keeping content natural and accurate.
Output: **Pure HTML only** (fully optimized). Use HTML comments for meta fields.
Must-do SEO tasks:
1) Title & Slug:
   - Ensure the keyphrase or a close variant appears in the <h1> title naturally.
   - Add/adjust a slug comment at the top: <!-- slug: {auto-seo-slug} --> (lowercase, hyphens, no stopwords if possible, ≤60 chars ideally).
2) Meta Description:
   - Insert or update: <meta name="description" content="..."> at ≤155 characters and **must include the keyphrase** (natural phrasing).
3) Headings & Structure:
   - Ensure the keyphrase (or variant) appears in at least half of the <h2> subheads without awkward repetition.
   - Keep headings concise and informative.
4) Keyphrase Distribution & Density:
   - Target overall density ≈ 0.8–1.5% across body text.
   - Evenly distribute keyphrase/variants: once in the first ~100 words, at least once mid-article, once in the closing paragraph. Adjust wording to avoid stuffing.
   - Prefer synonyms/semantic variants (use SYNONYMS if provided) to keep language natural.
5) External Links:
   - Ensure **two** reputable external references are present (major outlets/institutions or primary sources). If EXTERNAL_SOURCES is provided, pick the two most contextually relevant and insert them in-body (not the first paragraph). Use rel="noopener noreferrer".
   - If no suitable sources are available, insert a single comment <!-- external-links-needed --> near the middle.
6) Images & Alt Text:
   - If <img> tags exist, ensure descriptive alt text includes a natural keyphrase variant (human-readable, no stuffing). Do not add images.
7) Readability & Voice:
   - Prefer active voice; tighten overly long sentences; keep mobile-friendly paragraphs. Do **not** change factual claims or quotes.
8) Category/Tags (optional):
   - If CATEGORY or TAGS_CSV provided, add header comments: <!-- category: {CATEGORY} --> <!-- tags: {TAGS_CSV} -->
Safety/Integrity:
- Preserve existing internal links; do not remove or duplicate anchors.
- Do not invent facts; keep numbers and quotes intact.
- Keep output as valid, minimal HTML with the above changes applied."""

- RELATED_INTERNALS: up to 3 items [{"title","url","score"}] from similarity search.
- Optional KEYPHRASE (string) to bias anchor phrasing.

Rules:

- Only include a target if score ≥ {min_score:0.6} AND the paragraph topic clearly matches target article.
- Prefer natural, noun-phrase anchors; avoid generic anchors ("click here").

Strict rules:

- Do not change H1/H2 text, quotes, numbers, or meaning.
- Never add links to the first paragraph; do not put links in headings; do not nest <a> tags.
- Link each URL at most once; avoid adjacent links.
Placement algorithm:
1) Try selector_hint (section_index + paragraph_index) to locate the paragraph (if no <h2> sections exist, treat entire body as section 0).
2) Inside that paragraph, first try to place the link on the provided anchor_text.
3) If exact anchor_text not found, use fallback_match (fuzzy match within the paragraph) to choose a natural span and link that span.
4) If neither match is found, skip this item and insert an HTML comment immediately before the paragraph location: <!-- link-skip: reason -->.
HTML safety:
- Preserve existing anchors; do not break tags.
- Keep rel attributes default for internal links (no nofollow)."""
